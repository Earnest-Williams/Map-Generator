# Geographical Map Generator

A free web application for generating geographical maps with realistic terrain, biomes, rivers, lakes, and coastlines.

This tool focuses on creating realistic geographical features including:
- Heightmaps and terrain generation
- River and lake systems
- Biomes and climate zones
- Coastlines and ice formations
- Relief and elevation profiles

Based on Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator, stripped down to core geographical features.

Pull requests are welcomed. Please focus on geographical features and terrain generation improvements.
